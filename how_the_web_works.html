HTTP is the method a client uses to interact with a server to request Information 

A URL is the address a webpage is associated with so its information can be sent to a user on request 

DNS is “the phonebook of the internet.” It keeps track of all domain names and their associated IP addresses so we don’t have to memorize a random string of numbers

A query string part of a URL and it has data in it beyond just the main webpage address that gets passed to the webpage

GET is an HTTP request that simply retrieves Information from a server, while POST changes something on that server, like posting something to Facebook or Twitter 

An HTTP request is a request made by a client to a server to access information, like the contents of a webpage 

An HTTP response is what the server sends back to the client in response to an HTTP request, either providing the requested information or an error explaining that something went wrong

An HTTP header is used to send additional information back and forth between client and server in the form of key-value pairs. A couple examples are age (how long something has been in a cache) and expires (the time when a response will be considered stale.

When a user types a URL into a browser, the browser looks up the URL via DNS to get the right IP address for that domain name. Then it sends a HTTP request to the server at that IP address, which results in the server sending back an HTTP response and providing the requested information, assuming it exists.
